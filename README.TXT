Dev Notes: 
1. Parsing the text as sentences. Problems with delimiters. Full stop, ? and other punctuation marks. 
How am I going to tokenize the text: word by word? Sentence by sentence? 
2. Index has to be lower case.
3. File has to be cleaned of newline and other characters.
4. Use BreakIterator class
5. Tokenization should be independent of punctuation. Instead, node should be centered, preceded and followed by context.
